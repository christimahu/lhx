#                    Jetson Kubernetes Node Initializer (init_headless.sh)
#
# ====================================================================================
#
#  Purpose:
#  --------
#  This script is a comprehensive, "first-run" utility designed to transform a
#  freshly-imaged NVIDIA Jetson device into a hardened, headless server optimized
#  for use as a Kubernetes node. It automates all the essential "Day 0" setup
#  tasks, ensuring a consistent and reliable foundation for your cluster.
#
#  Tutorial Goal:
#  --------------
#  If you're new to Kubernetes or system administration, this script is your
#  first step. We will walk through preparing a physical machine for a cluster.
#  This involves configuring the network, minimizing the operating system for
#  security and performance, and optimizing storageâ€”all prerequisites for a
#  stable Kubernetes environment.
#
#  Workflow:
#  ---------
#  1. Flash a microSD card with the latest Jetson JetPack OS.
#  2. Boot the Jetson, complete the initial Ubuntu user setup, and connect to Ethernet.
#  3. Clone the repository containing this script onto the Jetson.
#  4. Run this script: `sudo ./init_headless.sh`
#  5. After it completes, reboot the device. The Jetson is now a prepared node.
#

# --- Tutorial: Why a Static IP is Critical for Kubernetes ---
# A Kubernetes cluster is a distributed system of multiple machines (nodes).
# The Control Plane (the cluster's brain) needs to reliably communicate with each
# Worker Node. If a node's IP address changes (which can happen with default DHCP
# settings), the Control Plane loses contact with it, marking it as "NotReady".
# This disrupts workloads running on that node and can cause cluster instability.
# By assigning a permanent, static IP, we ensure that each node has a stable,
# predictable address for the lifetime of the cluster. This is a fundamental
# requirement for any server, but especially for the members of a K8s cluster.
# ---

# We need to find the name of the primary network interface (e.g., enP8p1s0).
# The `ip route` command shows the kernel's routing table. We look for the 'default'
# route, which is the path for all traffic not destined for the local network.

# --- Tutorial: Disabling Swap Memory for Kubernetes ---
# This is a mandatory prerequisite for Kubernetes. The core K8s component on a node,

# the disk as slower, virtual RAM, makes this accounting difficult and unpredictable.
# If a container starts using swap, its performance becomes erratic, which defeats
# the purpose of Kubernetes' resource management. The kubelet is designed to
# enforce memory limits strictly; if a pod exceeds its memory, it should be terminated
# and restarted, not allowed to slow down the whole system by using disk swap.
#
# For official documentation, see:

# 1. Performance: An NVMe SSD has dramatically faster read/write speeds than a

#    pulls, quicker application startup times, and better performance for any
#    application that writes logs or data to disk.
# 2. Reliability: MicroSD cards are not designed for the constant, small read/write
#    operations of a server OS and are prone to wear and corruption over time.
#    An SSD is built for this workload and is far more reliable for a server that
#    will be running 24/7. We use the microSD card only to boot the system, and
