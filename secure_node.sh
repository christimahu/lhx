#           !! PLACEHOLDER SCRIPT - NOT YET IMPLEMENTED !!
#
#         Upgrade Kubernetes Node to use Secure HTTPS Registry
#                        (secure_node.sh)
#
# ====================================================================================
#
#  Purpose:
#  --------
#  This script will reconfigure a Kubernetes node to communicate with the local
#  container registry over a secure HTTPS connection. It's the final piece of the
#  puzzle for upgrading your cluster's security. It undoes the "insecure registry"
#  configuration and teaches the node to trust your new, private Certificate
#  Authority (CA).
#
#  Workflow:
#  ---------
#  1. First, run `generate_certs.sh` on the Raspberry Pi to create the certs.
#  2. Reconfigure your registry on the Pi to use HTTPS.
#  3. Run this script (`secure_node.sh`) on EVERY Kubernetes node (control planes
#     and workers).
#
#  Current Status:
#  ---------------
#  This is a placeholder. The commands are commented out. Running this script
#  will only print the actions it *will* perform in the future.
