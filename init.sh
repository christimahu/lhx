#                    Jetson Kubernetes Node Initializer (init.sh)
#
# ====================================================================================
#
#  Purpose:
#  --------
#  This script performs the complete "Day 0" configuration for a new NVIDIA
#  Jetson device that will be used as a Kubernetes node. It is designed to be
#  the first and only script you run on a freshly imaged microSD card.
#
#  Workflow:
#  ---------
#  1. Flash microSD with the latest Jetson JetPack OS.
#  2. Boot the Jetson, connect it to the network via Ethernet, and log in.
#  3. Clone the repository containing this script onto the Jetson.
#  4. Run this script: `sudo ./init.sh`
#  5. After it completes, reboot the device.
#
#  What it does:
#  -------------
#  ‚úÖ Configures a static IP address for reliable network access.
#  ‚úÖ (Optional) Migrates the entire operating system to a faster, more
#     durable NVMe SSD. This step is automatically skipped if already done.
#  ‚úÖ Removes the entire Ubuntu Desktop environment for a minimal, secure server.
#  ‚úÖ Disables swap memory, a requirement for Kubernetes.
#  ‚úÖ Updates the remaining system packages to the latest versions.
